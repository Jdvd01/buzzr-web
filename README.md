# Buzzr

Buzzr is an instant messaging platform that not only allows you to have direct communication with the members of your work team, but also makes it easy to assign tasks and keep track of them. What characterizes Buzzr is the "Buzz" method, a method in which team leaders can send the message to other Buzzr users through an email created from the same app. In this way, team leaders can highlight the most relevant information and ensure that it doesn't get lost in a sea of messages. Once the team leader has sent the Buzz, the recipient will receive a Pop-Up via Buzzr as a reminder that there is a pending conversation or task.
